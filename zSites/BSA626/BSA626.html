                <p>PROJECT:
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    For this project I will build a high quality intro cinematic for a game called "bashful".  Simple, Clean and focused on the character and what he does.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The mechanics of the game is to "push the characters buttons" via clicking the character enough to make him/her/it so annoyed that he/she/it will burst out in anger to start destroying everything and anything in its way.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    This game idea was inspired by the music video "The Verve - Bitter Sweet Symphony". and looking at the Elmo puppet in the classroom.

                Boom! Day two finished. Today was our day to present our brief to the other class members and get feedback on it. There were a bunch of interesting ideas from other members of the class.
                <br><br>
                I feel like the small brief I presented to the class was well thought out and the others people in the class responded positively. Some good examples were given for references I could use on my future endeavors for this project. 
                <br><br>
                There was actually quite a good little discussion on the science of cuteness and what others thought about it. Big head and big eyes. Will keep you posted…. (yes you..)
                <br><br>
                PS, I was able to play a bit of golf this morning as my stress release method. So far so good.

                Alright, here we are day 3 of the project. Pitch completed and have the greenlight to go ahead with the project. There have been a few thoughts overnight about some shots which I think could be cool for both technical learning opportunities and just think they would look cool. E.g. The opening shot is dark, spotlight clicks on as the character is blinded by the light for a little bit (first time reveal of the character to the audience) then lights flicker on behind the character like the scene in batman when the batcave lights turn on.
                <br>
                <br>
                Will pitch the idea today to the classmates.

                So back to school and present bashful to the class after doing the work on friday. The feedback was good and people were pleased with the direction it was going. 
                <br><br>
                Some key points of the critique was about the arrow possibly being the hand icon, we could explore that. Also the arc in the story could be pushed further and making the mouse cursor to become really cheeky.
                <br><br>

                I think that's a good idea. It would be silly to make the Story's storytelling elements to be weaker than they need to be. 
                <br><br>

                Another thing to think about for the next little bit is how to show enough expression through the characters body language and facial animations. Maybe if I am lucky and some help from Rachael, I could explore that facial rig motion capture thing.
                <br><br>

                Let's keep that in mind for the next few coming days.

                So today at home I have been experimenting with the Rig and getting the rust off my rigging skills haha (very basic skills). But with some minor success, I have been able to put together some sort of Squash and stretch rig.
                <br><br>
                For my first experiment I tried to place a Squash deformer on top of the mesh and thought I might be able to deform it via a Joint or something. But I didn't have much success with the 30mins I was experimenting, but maybe come back to this late for the mouse?

                The plan is to go into school now and try the experiment with a model which more closely resembles my character for the animation.
                <br><br>
                Also thinking about transferring this blog to my own website at this stage.

                Today I spent some time looking into the xGen fur system, its pretty epic I might look into it further for my character in bashful.
                <br><br>
                Some results here:

                Had a few errors when trying to playblast out the nurbscurves that are used to animate the fur. Later found out I need to cache the data before the GPU can handle it.
                <br> Learn something new everyday :D
                <br><br>
                Then with a bit of an Arnold Render

                        The early stages of this project brought up a few very important questions. For example: <br><br>
                        <span style="color: white; font-weight: bolder; font-size: 1.2rem;"> "What makes something cute?"</span><br><br>
                        A study by Konrad Lorenz in the early 1940s found that the shape of an infant's head positively correlated with adult caregiving and an increased perception of "cute". ... The study concluded that a large head shape increased perceived cuteness, which then elicited a positive response in adult caretaking.
                        <br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Change of head proportions (especially the relative size of the maxilla and mandible) as a function of age</li>
                            <li>Use of eyebrows is an effective way of making puppy dog eyes</li>

                        Looking into areas like Pixar for inspiration have been huge when setting out on this project,<br>
                        I remember the huge amount of joy <a href="https://www.pixar.com/geris-game">Geri's game" </a> brought to me as a kid. <br>
                        <br>
                        Its a big goal to try acheive something that good, but "aim high fall short" is my approach for this one.
                        <br><br>
                        <span style="color: white; font-weight: bolder; font-size: 1.2rem;">How am I going to create enough expression from such a limited character?<br><br></span>
                        <br><br>
                        This was a big one, there is both the look and feel of the character which is hard enough on it's own. There was also the question of the rig
                        and how to acheivea type of movement that I am going for.
                        <br><br>
                        I played with some Squash and stretch rig setups as seen in the photos.

                        While studying at SIT we had a discussion about lighting moodboards and how to use the light to influence the mood of our animations.<br>
                        <br>
                        I am going to try some Renders early on and see if they are the look I am going for.
                        <br><br>
                        With some testing, the renders of the fur turned out quite nice. <br>
                        <br>
                        <span style="color: white; font-weight: bolder; font-size: 1.2rem;"> How to go from this stage, to a closer look and feel towards "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"?</span>
