                <p>PROJECT:
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    For this project I will build a high quality intro cinematic for a game called "bashful".  Simple, Clean and focused on the character and what he does.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The mechanics of the game is to "push the characters buttons" via clicking the character enough to make him/her/it so annoyed that he/she/it will burst out in anger to start destroying everything and anything in its way.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    This game idea was inspired by the music video "The Verve - Bitter Sweet Symphony". and looking at the Elmo puppet in the classroom.
                    <br/>

                Boom! Day two finished. Today was our day to present our brief to the other class members and get feedback on it. There were a bunch of interesting ideas from other members of the class.
                <br/>
                I feel like the small brief I presented to the class was well thought out and the others people in the class responded positively. Some good examples were given for references I could use on my future endeavors for this project. 
                <br/>
                There was actually quite a good little discussion on the science of cuteness and what others thought about it. Big head and big eyes. Will keep you postedâ€¦. (yes you..)
                <br/>
                PS, I was able to play a bit of golf this morning as my stress release method. So far so good.
