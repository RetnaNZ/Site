                <p>PROJECT:
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    For this project I will build a high quality intro cinematic for a game called "bashful".  Simple, Clean and focused on the character and what he does.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The mechanics of the game is to "push the characters buttons" via clicking the character enough to make him/her/it so annoyed that he/she/it will burst out in anger to start destroying everything and anything in its way.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    This game idea was inspired by the music video "The Verve - Bitter Sweet Symphony". and looking at the Elmo puppet in the classroom.
                    <br/>

                Boom! Day two finished. Today was our day to present our brief to the other class members and get feedback on it. There were a bunch of interesting ideas from other members of the class.
                <br><br>
                I feel like the small brief I presented to the class was well thought out and the others people in the class responded positively. Some good examples were given for references I could use on my future endeavors for this project. 
                <br><br>
                There was actually quite a good little discussion on the science of cuteness and what others thought about it. Big head and big eyes. Will keep you posted…. (yes you..)
                <br><br>
                PS, I was able to play a bit of golf this morning as my stress release method. So far so good.

                Alright, here we are day 3 of the project. Pitch completed and have the greenlight to go ahead with the project. There have been a few thoughts overnight about some shots which I think could be cool for both technical learning opportunities and just think they would look cool. E.g. The opening shot is dark, spotlight clicks on as the character is blinded by the light for a little bit (first time reveal of the character to the audience) then lights flicker on behind the character like the scene in batman when the batcave lights turn on.
                <br>
                <br>
                Will pitch the idea today to the classmates.

                So back to school and present bashful to the class after doing the work on friday. The feedback was good and people were pleased with the direction it was going. 
                <br><br>
                Some key points of the critique was about the arrow possibly being the hand icon, we could explore that. Also the arc in the story could be pushed further and making the mouse cursor to become really cheeky.
                <br><br>

                I think that's a good idea. It would be silly to make the Story's storytelling elements to be weaker than they need to be. 
                <br><br>

                Another thing to think about for the next little bit is how to show enough expression through the characters body language and facial animations. Maybe if I am lucky and some help from Rachael, I could explore that facial rig motion capture thing.
                <br><br>

                Let's keep that in mind for the next few coming days.

                So today at home I have been experimenting with the Rig and getting the rust off my rigging skills haha (very basic skills). But with some minor success, I have been able to put together some sort of Squash and stretch rig.
                <br><br>
                For my first experiment I tried to place a Squash deformer on top of the mesh and thought I might be able to deform it via a Joint or something. But I didn't have much success with the 30mins I was experimenting, but maybe come back to this late for the mouse?

                The plan is to go into school now and try the experiment with a model which more closely resembles my character for the animation.
                <br><br>
                Also thinking about transferring this blog to my own website at this stage.

                Some results here:

                Had a few errors when trying to playblast out the nurbscurves that are used to animate the fur. Later found out I need to cache the data before the GPU can handle it.
                <br> Learn something new everyday :D
                <br><br>
                Then with a bit of an Arnold Render

                Boom, the month of February has now left us and March is here! <br><br>

                So just a reflection on the month that has passed, I have learnt a good amount of 3D skills Thanks to Rachel.
                There is alot of things that are clicking this time studying and I am alot more focused, dare I say "I am really enjoying 3D"?
                <br><br>
                What does this month ahead have in store for us?
                <br><br>
                As far as class work, I dont actually know what the tutor has planned for us, but the 1 minute animation is our big project for a good while. 
                For myself, I am going to try my best to really focus in class and absorb all the knowledge from Rachel. <br>
                <br>
                The personal focus for this month is going to be all about Topology and Modeling clean, I really would like to nail those skills. <br><br>

                I will keep you posted as the month goes on.

                Writing Custom Shaders seems so cool, but it always blows my mind what the GPU is able to do each frame. CRAZY!

                It was nice to be back at school and get some feedback on my assignment as of now. <br>
                Glad Rachel was able to give me some advice for transfering my web page into a properly formatted PDF file. <br>
                <br>
                I handed in the assignment early as I was happy with where it was at. The whole formatted project thing is different, 
                just because I have been learning by myself for quite a while now. <br>
                Thinking its going to be one of those skills in the future that I might not realise the importance until later. <br>

                Finding a good rythmn with this study thing this year, I am actually really enjoying the 3D development. <br>
                Although I sometimes wish I am able to move quicker, its not always a bad thing though, slowing down helps me focus on the details. <br>
                So hopefully by the end of this course I will have something super polished to show potential employers. <br>
                <br>
                BREAK INTO THE INDUSTRY! <br>
                <br>
                Thats my major goal from this year. <br>
                <br>
                I have been looking into a few avenues today, Shaders, Mel and Python scripting in Maya, height based textures. <br>
                Doing all of this after hearing about the Tech Artist role from this video on youtube. <br><br>

                New week, new missions. I am concentrating on finalising the characters models this week. <br>
                Feeling the design translates well over 2D, but finding the right way to make it into 3D is a tricky one. <br>
                <br>
                Here is a sketch I did today of bashful and then next to it is the 3D version I tried to accomplish. <br> <br>

                So it is truning out to be quite tricky to get the same results. <br>
                Luckly for me I am doubled up on Fur research for the project in the Advanced Animation class. Hopefully that means more study, quicker results.

                <br><br>
                I will keep at this for a little bit until I find results I am happy with. He does look kinda cool though.

                Last week Thursdy we started modeling and learning about human topology. <br>
				It was just the beginning introduction for the learning process, but there was a good bit of information we had picked up on.
				<br><br>
				Feed back from the class today was looking at the roundness of the topology, its a good tip and reminder that the shape of the loops are going to deform funkey if they are not evenly spaced. Peace!

            <div class="blog-content">
                Quick little blog input. Start of our 2 week holiday, so its time to organise where I am at. I am a little concerned about having to constantly re-evaluate where I am and what I am trying to get out of my projects. I wonder if this is normal.

                <br><br>
                I have heard that my documents are sometimes referred to as “living documents”, that could be a sign for something to expect out of these projects.

                <br><br>
                What is my big goal from this project “Bashful” 

                <br><br>
                I want to create a clean and polished 3D cinematic that gets people interested in the final product.

                <br><br>
				How am I supposed to portray this?

				<br><br>
				At the moment, I have put some childish humor into the skit to draw the attention of a younger demographic. Something I might have wanted to watch when I was younger as it's fun and exciting, full of anticipation for the audience to feel smart for predicting what is supposed to happen next.

				<br><br>
				The quality of this project matters. I am wanting to push myself to the max to see where my skill currently stands. That way I can see which areas need more work :D

				<br><br>
				Where is the project now?

				<br><br>
				Last see, I had just created a mock-up character to get the animatic going. It is Modeled and UV unwrapped in a way I feel is correct, I also put a small rig into it to help get the animatic going a bit faster.
				
				<br><br>
				Some issues you are having at the moment?

				<br><br>
				I still feel like my final concept is not complete yet, I don't really know how I want the final piece to look in the end.

				<br><br>
				Animation limitations.

				<br><br>
				
				I am having concerns about the art style of my bashful project. It feels a bit blurry, I still feel like my final concept is not complete yet, I don't really know how I want the final piece to look in the end. I have experienced this with personal drawings where it looks terrible in the early stages, while I block in the important foundations, then refine it over time into something I want.

				I am exploring a bit of this today.
				
				<br><br>
				Lets see if we can experiment with this today. 
				
				<br><br>
				Am I supposed to have the final piece, look and feel, color and composition all finalised in my head before even putting pen to paper? (e.g. using reference)
				<br><br>
				How does this work when you don't have reference?
				<br><br>
				This feels a bit like a topic that starts making more sense the more you write it aloud, common sense kind of starts to do its magic :D
				<br><br>
				Okay, here we go. Three drawings. One with reference, one without but try my hardest to visualize the finished product, then last without anything in mind.


				<br><br>
				Quite a good forum with people actually inputting some good information:

				Quick update for the bashful project.

				<br><br>
				From the critiques so far in class, there have been minor changes that need to be done, the addition of the arrow into the scene to help with the visual communication that my character is expressing.
				
				<br><br>
				I would like to finalise my characters look and feel for the next handin stage.
				
				<br><br>
				For the spiritual and technical side of things I am wanting to see if there is any way I can push the character further along through a more detailed expression especially with the eyes.
				
				<br><br>
				Will keep you posted.

				Anzac weekend!


				<br><br>
				Feels like funny timing to have a long weekend right after a holiday. But also really liking it :D
				
				<br><br>
				I have enjoyed the bonus time to think on a few deeper topics over the past week. Things at the start of last week were feeling a little down. I was not really feeling like I was gaining much from attending the course. While progress on the technical side of things is slow, there is a big emotional gain from all of this stuff. I am finding this is actually one of the hidden bonuses for when it comes to taking time off life to come down here to study. The ability to think a bit further down the rabbit hole without distractions.

				
				<br><br>
				The development of the Spiritual versus Technical skills have matured over the past month. Now the look into this is at any stage of your aartistic technical skill level you are able to develop and express the spiritual side of your work, which takes a whole lot of time and effort to train that muscle. BUT! The work's ability to express the spiritual idea with clarity comes down to how well versed you are on the technical skill set. Hopefully this makes sense for the readers out there :P

				
				<br><br>
				The idea is still brewing, so please don't take this as the all out finished conclusion.
				
				<br><br>
				One thing about this project that I am trying to figure out is the ability for me to know when to change the end goals while in the production phase. I would probably expect when doing client work, you would ideally want to agree on a final product at the beginning and want to change as little as possible. But how does that fit compared to personal work like these projects at SIT. 
				
				<br><br>
				Good question for Rachel when back in class.

				Over the weekend I had found some cool videos that I would love to use for some inspiration. <br>
				This video of Emumu gives me some ideas for the bashful model build. <br><br>

				I am going to go back and assess the beginning stages of the project again and see if I can bring some respect to the initial vision.


				<br><br>
				
				I feel as if I moved away from the art direction set in the pre production as the technical challenge of acheiving this was a bit scary. <br>
				
				But I want to try this again. It should hopefully help me make more gains. <br> <br>
				
				<br>
				
				I am thinking the best way to approach this is to go back to my 2D work and see if i can quickly sketch out the character in the correct art style, and find some more examples of how the art style I am going for will work in 3D. Especially for the fur component of my character. How do they do hair in Borderlands? <br> <br>

				So the review from the class review was minimal, just a few questions about the lighting. But besides that there was not too much feedback. But a cool idea came up from Ben, he asked, "was it intentional to have the maya UI in view of the camera as an excuse for the cursor to be there."
				
				<br><br>
				
				I really like that idea, it felt a bit strange to just have a cursor show up in the scene.
				
				<br><br>
				
				Rachel gave me some good questions about my idea of making some dramatic changes this late in the project. I gave her a couple reasons for why I want to make the changes like, I am beginning to become a little lazy with this class and I need to push myself along a bit harder in order to get the most out of this class.
				
				<br><br>
				
				How long will these changes take to implement? are the changes viable? what challenges can you foresee coming up as a result of this?
				
				<br><br>
				
				Here is a quick frame of what the look might be like. <br><br>

				Chunky fur like a labrador, deep set spherical eyes like Amumu off League of Legends, a mouth of a moster to help express the story.
				
				<br><br>
				
				Will keep you posted.
				
				<br><br>
				
				Little video post for the blog, just checking out this fur breakdown. I like realistic look, there might be alot to learn from trying to learn the realistic stuff.

				<br><br>
				
				It might be a good idea to quickly see if its possible to replicate the fur look and feel from a sphere and then transfer the technical skills directly to the character model. I guess this is where I was at previously before straying away from the original art style.
				
				<br><br>
				
				Lets do this right after lunch. The payoff for learning fur will also benefit the Advanced Animation class.

				One thing I have seen after watching the enter the spiderman enter the spidy verse breakdown was the softness of the skin for the original model.

				Coming back to the fur and hair. Towards the beginning of this project I was actually making some good progress into how fur is made.
				I stopped the along the way for some reason because the results that I was getting was nothing close to what I had invisioned.
				
				
				<br><br>
				
				I am coming back to it now hoping to fix my mistakes from the previous try. Which were.
				
				<br><br>
				
				Not picking a clear art direction so I was beginning to lose sight of any sort of goal. This time around I have in mind a particular look and feel that I want to acomplish. which I will post into my Miro Board. here 
				
				<br> <br>
				
				https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lVWa09w=/
				
				<br><br>
				
				I have been lookin at a few videos on youtube of quick showcases for characters that have a stong emphisis on Fur to detail their look and feel. Check them out here.

				<br><br>
				
				Also I thought this guy had an interesting point to mention about fur in media. He says sometimes the time and effort people put into advancing fur could be better used on bigger aspects for the film. This kind of touches on the same idea about the spirit side vs the technical side of a piece of work. Pretty cool, although he has about 50% of people disagree with his video.

				<br><br>
				
				I am a little lost for what technology is best used for fur, but maybe I will start with what is infront of me with the xGen system and branch out from there.
				
				<br><br>
				
				I had just tried to play with the preset fur builds in maya, but they do not render out with Arnold. I am not sure if I have the time to troubleshoot this at the moment as I want to see results early on in this stage. Here is a screen shot of the preset fur elements.

				I have been reading throught some of the features that this 3Delight package is able to produce. I might be getting a little ahead of myself. Its might be best to stick with the xGen system for this project and on a future one we can branch out from there. Fur is a major stage for me on this project and I need to spend all the time I can to understand the in's and outs of fur/hair generation.
				
				Check some of their fur.

				Did some experimentation with the xGen systems, something I found was the groomable splines is great for short fur builds. <br><br>
				using the "splines" instead of the "groomable Splines" both have different uses.

				<br>
				Have been exploring how the hair is distributed along the mesh.<br>
				
				It looks like the maya is looking at the UV locations and placing along he surface normals with a mathematical formula.<br>

				Here is an example of what selecting the faces before creating the xGen Description.<br>
<br>
				<img src="./blogimages/weekten/HairDescriptionUsingUV.PNG" alt="borderlandsFur" width="90%"><br>
<br>
				And here is an example of what happens when selecting the entire object but using only a certian amount of splines.<br>

				<img src="./blogimages/weekten/HairDescriptionUsingUV_forgot2.PNG" alt="borderlandsFur" width="90%"><br>
<br>
				One other thing that I have found with mucking around on the xGen system, is that sometimes the fur system wont render unless you save the scene and "Export patch for Batch Render". Still things I dont quite understand about the xGen system.<br>
<br>
				I am now going to experiment with the cards to render out the hair/fur because this first style is not accomplishing the look and feel I am after just yet. I have a few ideas of how I might be able to accomplish it with the current splines, but for the game development things I don't believe they render out using splines.<br>
<br>
				Now been using the pencil curve tool to groom the guides and once I am happy with how the curves look, I then convert them from curves to guides. Looking through the settings aswell has given me a better understanding of what effects you can come up with.<br><br>

				<img src="./blogimages/weekten/Fur_with_pencil_tool_curves_settings2.PNG" alt="borderlandsFur" width="90%">
				
				<br><br>
				
				Some pretty interesting results with this tool so far. Will keep yah posted.<br>

				<img src="./blogimages/weekten/Animwires2.PNG" alt="borderlandsFur" width="90%"><br>
<br>
				Played a bit with the anim wire system for the xGen hair. It turned out to be quite annoying as the nHair system did not attach to the xGen guides. But after starting again, the results started working again.<br>
<br>
				But this was a good day well spent. I will do some character rework later tonight and try my best to put some more fur on the character. Will keep yah posted. <br>
<br>
				Thanks to this video.<br>

OH MY GOSH! <br>
<br>


What a painful learning experience I have had over the past 2 days. I have been constantly hitting my head against this xGen simulation not being able to batch render how I want. <br>
<br>


But alas, I have overcome the issue and am all the better for it. It feels like I have just been to the brain gym and done a few sets too many.<br>
<br>


So the background story behind this all started when I have gone back a few steps to rework my bashful project. I was feeling like my project was not staying true to the course I had set for myself at the beginning, as I slowly changed my project's view because I was having difficulties getting the fur to work how I wanted it to.<br>
<br>


Around the time just before the holiday I had begun noticing that my learning had been slowing down and due to this I was also beginning to not enjoy the course as much, So I made a choice when I came back after the holiday to challenge myself to get over this hurdle and tackle the problem at hand instead of going around it.<br>
<br>


So to bring things closer to where we are now. About two days ago I started with the xGen process from where I had left off previously, it was a little confusing to begin with after not touching it for so long. But after a few attempts I was able to groom my models how I liked.<br>
<br>


One of the first issues I was having from time to time was that my renders were not showing up in the Arnold render view, This was simple enough to fix, I simply had to save my scene before rendering it and that would normally fix the problem.<br>
				
				<img src="./blogimages/weekeleven/intersting_hair_rendered.PNG" alt="RenderThroughArnold" width="90%">
<br>


The next issue I ran into wass the render was not coming out with the fur if I batch rendered it. I was a little confused as to why it comes out fine in the render, but not in a batch Render, arn’t they the same thing, just multiple times?
<br>
<br>

Turns out that the Renderer Arnold is a completely separate piece of software, so the difference being, when you render the scene in maya, Arnold render view is able to get all the data locally from the Maya document. Compared to  when you send the data to the Arnold externally, it does not have the computed information of the Hair/Fur. This is where Caching (pre calculating) and xGen’s inbuilt patch to Batch Render comes into play.
<br>
<br>

After kinda understanding this a little better, I was able to Export Patches to Batch Render, or in other words, send the data of the Hair Description to Arnold in a packet of data. So I hit batch render and I had a single frame of my fur rendered Externally from Maya and into Arnold on its own! WOOHOO! 
<br>
<br>

My time of troubleshooting for the first day was over. I had gone home and slept it off. Funny enough, that night I woke up in the middle of the night with my mind thinking about batch rendering an animation.  Of the xGen system.
So! Now day two of trouble shooting and getting things to work. Remember at this stage none of this really made sense and I was continually having to go back and write down what it was exactly that I was trying to accomplish. Sometimes the questions had easy answers and other times I couldn’t think straight.
<br>
<br>



About 50 Batch renders in and still no results like I was looking for. I took this approach.
<br>
				<img src="./blogimages/weekeleven/renderTrals.PNG" alt="TryingToRender" width="90%">
<br>

Can I Batch render a single frame of fur.
Can I Rotate my geo and render a different frame of fur position.
Can I Add dynamic curves and see them working in Maya
Can I see the dynamic curves out of Batch Render
<br>
<br>

I found through this process, I was able to trouble shoot the right things at the right stages. And finally I had a result! I rendered out a simulated version of my xGen Groom!
<br>
<br>

I came home and tried it on my personal pc.
<br>
<br>

IT DIDN'T WORK!?
<br>
<br>

Until later I found that there was a space in my files directory. Which was the culprit of 4 hours or trial and error.
<br>
				<img src="./blogimages/weekeleven/space.PNG" alt="SpaceDirectory" width="90%">
<br>


But I have it working now and so much better for all the troubles.
<br>
<br>

Time to build and groom my character how I want now, then export him out in an animation.
<br>
<br>

Yay me!

				How do we do?<br>
<br>
Had a good little weekend of progress, we discovered the magic of Caching data, how xGen works and now, How to tie it all together into one nice little animation.<br>
<br>
So it has been quite productive.<br>
<br>
Lastnight I modeled the new and I.M.O. Cuter version of the character. I had done this little sketch of him and thought the deeper inset eyes just helps the character personality pop.<br>
<br>
				<img src="blogimages/weekeleven/NEWCHARACTERUPDATE.png" alt="new Character sketch" style="width: 70%">
				<br>
<br>

				So I set out with a quick Zbrush model and got the primary shapes into place and then took the sculpt back to Maya for retopo and UV unwrapping. After that I took it back into Zbrush to make more tweaks and subdivided it once at this stage.<br>
				<img src="blogimages/weekeleven/bashful_newModel.PNG" alt="new Character sketch" style="width: 70%">
				<img src="blogimages/weekeleven/bashful_newModel_Side.PNG" alt="new Character sketch" style="width: 90%">
				<br>
<br>
				After the models base was kinda where I wanted it, it was time to tackle the next unknown adventure of grooming to a stage that I would be happy with. (honestly, I am not really sure I am 100% certian this is the look I will stick with.) But none the less, I placed the fur on, Then tested out the same batch rendering method I had with my earlier blog. Gladly I was plesently happy with the results. Check it out here.<br>
<br>
				<iframe width="720" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qQf7-7xhWFE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
<br>
				So Continuing on with this I thought the next test to do would be to Rig the character and try my luck at animation with the groom. Fingers were crossed that there was not going to be many more unknowns come out of nowhere. <br>
				Throughout the process of rigging and testing there was some entertaining results. Check it! Batman is bashful.
				<br>
<br>
				<img src="blogimages/weekeleven/ITS_ME.PNG" alt="new Character sketch" style="width: 90%"><br>
<br>
				And after some more testing, I animated a quick star jump cycle and rendered it out. I rendered out the first batch and bashful didn't move an inch. So I went through and checked my settings, I tried with Live mode active and live mode off for the simulation, no changes. I checked if there was anything in the xgen settings. Nothing.<br>
<br>
				I did like 4 or 5 batch renders of 25 frames a piece, and nothing was happening.<br>
<br>

				Then.... I checked if I had Image Sequence active..... Silly sausage, It wasn't even checked. But as a result of this I found out that Live mode and all those other batch renders turned out fine.<br>
<br>
				Ended up with this little piece that I am happy enough with for now. I will keep tweaking a few things tomorrow in class. But for a quick weekends work, this is cool.<br>

				Howdy Partner!<br>
<br>
We have had a week of trial and errors, it has actually been good regardless of all the pain.<br>
<br>
From working out how the xGen works and Arnold renders out externally. I have become a much stronger technically. <br>
<br>
For our enjoyment, here are a few goodies from the week past.<br>

				<img src="blogimages/weektwelve/Test2.png" alt="new Character sketch" style="width: 70%">
				<img src="blogimages/weektwelve/Test5.png" alt="new Character sketch" style="width: 70%">

				<img src="blogimages/weektwelve/Test7.jpg" alt="new Character sketch" style="width: 70%">
				<br>
<br>
				I had learnt a bunch through all this trial and error. One of the major learning curves was the data of the nucleus is stored at 0,0,0 while at frame one. So the place of origin for when you first create the xGen nucleus is going to get confused if you decide to change that place of origin when you move it.<br>
<br>
				But after doing a bit more work, it ended up lookng pretty good. So here is some of the shots from that.<br>

                    For this project I will build a high quality intro cinematic for a game called "bashful".  
                    <br> My focus for this project is to create the highest quality product possible for my current skill level.
                    <br> The final outcome should be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">clean and crisp renders with smooth and silky animations.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    The mechanics I have invisioned for this game are of the 3D platformer genre, similar to "Crash Bandicoot".
                    Our main character will have the ability to burst into a rageful "power up" form once enough points have been collected. <br>
                    Making it easier for him to destroy objects and enemies to collect points.
                    <br><br>
                    Showing these elements in the cinematic are going to be my main targets to hit.
                    <br><br>
                    This inspiration for this game came from a few sources, the music video <span style="font-style: italic;">"The Verve - Bitter Sweet Symphony" </span>
                    the game <span style="font-style: italic;">"Burnout","Crash Bandicoot"</span> and from <span style="font-style: italic;">"Elmo"</span>

                <br><br>



                Opening shot: mid-shot.
                    Frame is pitch black, nothing is to be seen. (stage lights sound effect starts) white Spotlight lights center of frame with our character being blinded by the light (like the Mr Bean intro). Reacts like a possum in the headlights of a car. (the sound of more stage lights begin to click, like the batcave scene. *see reference board*) bright white LED panels light the entire room, which reveals nothing much but a blank room and the character.
                <br><br>
                Characters body language and facial expressions portray a shy/timid creature which does not like being “in the spotlight”. The character is confused about where it is and what is going on.
                <br><br>

                The character spots something off screen which the audience cannot see. A 3D computer cursor floats into the shot from right to left. 
                <br><br>

                Character is curious as to what this strange thing is. Cautiously looking at the cursor, the cursor suddenly floats around the back of the character and clicks on its bottom. Character jumps and reacts with a slight hop. The character is still quite unsure about what just happened, but a little more cautiously this time looks towards the floating cursor.
                <br><br>
                As the cursor slowly starts to move again, the Character tries to slowly follow around with the cursor hoping not to be caught off guard like last time. Suddenly the mouse quickly whips around the back of the character and clicks on its bottom again. With another jump from the character.
                <br><br>

                Now the Character has some idea of what is going on and is beginning to become upset at the situation (shown both with body and face language). The audience should also get a clue about what is going on. 
                <br><br>

                So now the duet has begun, the cursor starts to slowly “prowl” around the character. Almost like a western movie standoff. The cursor’s movement is too fast for our character and begins to click him over and over again, almost toying with him,
                <br><br>

                The Character does not like this one bit. The cursor starts to get really cheeky and starts to laugh (through body language), Suddenly there is a change in lighting as the character begins to growl, followed by shaking of his fur, followed by an angry expression and growing of his body size.
                <br><br>

                The camera slowly zooms out to show the size comparison between the mouse and character now. The character mammoths the size of the small cursor.
                <br><br>

                Our character has a big grin come across his face as he twists his body in anticipation of a big release of energy. *The cursor gulps*.
                <br><br>

                The Character unwinds and begins a devastating spin attack, as the floor begins to tear towards the center and the cursor wooshes in a tornado of destruction. The camera which the audience is watching from also begins to shake and move towards the mess.
                <br><br>

                The camera screen cracks. Title “bashful” flies from off screen as announcer’s voice over says the name of the game and which devices you can purchase the game.

                        I can foresee challenges for both avenues.

                            The early stages of this project brought up a few very important questions. For example: <br><br>
                            <span style="color: white; font-weight: bolder; font-size: 1.2rem;"> "What makes something cute?"</span><br><br>
                            A study by Konrad Lorenz in the early 1940s found that the shape of an infant's head positively correlated with adult caregiving and an increased perception of "cute". ... The study concluded that a large head shape increased perceived cuteness, which then elicited a positive response in adult caretaking.
                            <br><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Change of head proportions (especially the relative size of the maxilla and mandible) as a function of age</li>
                                <li>Use of eyebrows is an effective way of making puppy dog eyes</li>
                            </ul>

                        <br><br>
                        This was a big one, there is both the look and feel of the character which is hard enough on it's own. There was also the question of the rig
                        and how to acheive the type of movement that I am going for.
                        <br><br>
                        It has been a long time since I have played with rigging and "all of its wonderful features!"... Hahaha, no but after a few years
                        of life experience, alot more things are clicking and I was able to pull off a pretty successful Squash and stretch rig setup.
                        <br><br>
                        I will need much more experimentation to see exactly what type of animation movement I am going for. Will keep you posted.

                        There is a whole lot to learn when it comes to fur/hair, as our tutor said "Fur has its own entire industry, within the industry". <br><br>

                        A but daunting I know, but my families motto has always been "do the mahi! get the treats!". So I am going to dive head first into this one. <br><br>

                        Pretty early stages as of now, making some progress towards the goal. But still quite a bit of work to do in order to get ito looking how I want.

                The background of our character "bashful" is an interesting story. <br>
                You see, the particular species which bashful comes from, reproduce VERY quickly, which makes finding enough land for them to live on exponentially more difficult. Last I checked they spawn 30 young : 1 grown. each month. <br>
                our character bashful may look cute and peaceful on the outside, but that is just a genetic modification to bring people in close enough to devour them. <br><br>

                Anyway's I digress, he is looking for more planets to help the expansion of his species. despite the looks, bashful is actually an elite "scout" from his home galaxy "bluffel" (even the galexy names are cute!).<br>

                Oh. and the cursor is human(teenager).
