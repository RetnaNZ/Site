                <p>PROJECT:
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    For this project I will build a high quality intro cinematic for a game called "bashful".  Simple, Clean and focused on the character and what he does.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The mechanics of the game is to "push the characters buttons" via clicking the character enough to make him/her/it so annoyed that he/she/it will burst out in anger to start destroying everything and anything in its way.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    This game idea was inspired by the music video "The Verve - Bitter Sweet Symphony". and looking at the Elmo puppet in the classroom.
                    <br/>

                Boom! Day two finished. Today was our day to present our brief to the other class members and get feedback on it. There were a bunch of interesting ideas from other members of the class.
                <br><br>
                I feel like the small brief I presented to the class was well thought out and the others people in the class responded positively. Some good examples were given for references I could use on my future endeavors for this project. 
                <br><br>
                There was actually quite a good little discussion on the science of cuteness and what others thought about it. Big head and big eyes. Will keep you posted…. (yes you..)
                <br><br>
                PS, I was able to play a bit of golf this morning as my stress release method. So far so good.

                Alright, here we are day 3 of the project. Pitch completed and have the greenlight to go ahead with the project. There have been a few thoughts overnight about some shots which I think could be cool for both technical learning opportunities and just think they would look cool. E.g. The opening shot is dark, spotlight clicks on as the character is blinded by the light for a little bit (first time reveal of the character to the audience) then lights flicker on behind the character like the scene in batman when the batcave lights turn on.
                <br>
                <br>
                Will pitch the idea today to the classmates.

                So back to school and present bashful to the class after doing the work on friday. The feedback was good and people were pleased with the direction it was going. 
                <br><br>
                Some key points of the critique was about the arrow possibly being the hand icon, we could explore that. Also the arc in the story could be pushed further and making the mouse cursor to become really cheeky.
                <br><br>

                I think that's a good idea. It would be silly to make the Story's storytelling elements to be weaker than they need to be. 
                <br><br>

                Another thing to think about for the next little bit is how to show enough expression through the characters body language and facial animations. Maybe if I am lucky and some help from Rachael, I could explore that facial rig motion capture thing.
                <br><br>

                Let's keep that in mind for the next few coming days.

                So today at home I have been experimenting with the Rig and getting the rust off my rigging skills haha (very basic skills). But with some minor success, I have been able to put together some sort of Squash and stretch rig.
                <br><br>
                For my first experiment I tried to place a Squash deformer on top of the mesh and thought I might be able to deform it via a Joint or something. But I didn't have much success with the 30mins I was experimenting, but maybe come back to this late for the mouse?

                The plan is to go into school now and try the experiment with a model which more closely resembles my character for the animation.
                <br><br>
                Also thinking about transferring this blog to my own website at this stage.

                Some results here:

                Had a few errors when trying to playblast out the nurbscurves that are used to animate the fur. Later found out I need to cache the data before the GPU can handle it.
                <br> Learn something new everyday :D
                <br><br>
                Then with a bit of an Arnold Render

                Boom, the month of February has now left us and March is here! <br><br>

                So just a reflection on the month that has passed, I have learnt a good amount of 3D skills Thanks to Rachel.
                There is alot of things that are clicking this time studying and I am alot more focused, dare I say "I am really enjoying 3D"?
                <br><br>
                What does this month ahead have in store for us?
                <br><br>
                As far as class work, I dont actually know what the tutor has planned for us, but the 1 minute animation is our big project for a good while. 
                For myself, I am going to try my best to really focus in class and absorb all the knowledge from Rachel. <br>
                <br>
                The personal focus for this month is going to be all about Topology and Modeling clean, I really would like to nail those skills. <br><br>

                I will keep you posted as the month goes on.

                Writing Custom Shaders seems so cool, but it always blows my mind what the GPU is able to do each frame. CRAZY!

                It was nice to be back at school and get some feedback on my assignment as of now. <br>
                Glad Rachel was able to give me some advice for transfering my web page into a properly formatted PDF file. <br>
                <br>
                I handed in the assignment early as I was happy with where it was at. The whole formatted project thing is different, 
                just because I have been learning by myself for quite a while now. <br>
                Thinking its going to be one of those skills in the future that I might not realise the importance until later. <br>

                Finding a good rythmn with this study thing this year, I am actually really enjoying the 3D development. <br>
                Although I sometimes wish I am able to move quicker, its not always a bad thing though, slowing down helps me focus on the details. <br>
                So hopefully by the end of this course I will have something super polished to show potential employers. <br>
                <br>
                BREAK INTO THE INDUSTRY! <br>
                <br>
                Thats my major goal from this year. <br>
                <br>
                I have been looking into a few avenues today, Shaders, Mel and Python scripting in Maya, height based textures. <br>
                Doing all of this after hearing about the Tech Artist role from this video on youtube. <br><br>

                New week, new missions. I am concentrating on finalising the characters models this week. <br>
                Feeling the design translates well over 2D, but finding the right way to make it into 3D is a tricky one. <br>
                <br>
                Here is a sketch I did today of bashful and then next to it is the 3D version I tried to accomplish. <br> <br>

                <br><br>
                So it is truning out to be quite tricky to get the same results. <br>
                Luckly for me I am doubled up on Fur research for the project in the Advanced Animation class. Hopefully that means more study, quicker results.

                <br><br>
                I will keep at this for a little bit until I find results I am happy with. He does look kinda cool though.

                Last week Thursdy we started modeling and learning about human topology. <br>
				It was just the beginning introduction for the learning process, but there was a good bit of information we had picked up on.
				<br><br>
				Feed back from the class today was looking at the roundness of the topology, its a good tip and reminder that the shape of the loops are going to deform funkey if they are not evenly spaced. Peace!

                    For this project I will build a high quality intro cinematic for a game called "bashful".  
                    <br> My focus for this project is to create the highest quality product possible for my current skill level.
                    <br> The final outcome should be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">clean and crisp renders with smooth and silky animations.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    The mechanics I have invisioned for this game are of the 3D platformer genre, similar to "Crash Bandicoot".
                    Our main character will have the ability to burst into a rageful "power up" form once enough points have been collected. <br>
                    Making it easier for him to destroy objects and enemies to collect points.
                    <br><br>
                    Showing these elements in the cinematic are going to be my main targets to hit.
                    <br><br>
                    This inspiration for this game came from a few sources, the music video <span style="font-style: italic;">"The Verve - Bitter Sweet Symphony" </span>
                    the game <span style="font-style: italic;">"Burnout","Crash Bandicoot"</span> and from <span style="font-style: italic;">"Elmo"</span>

                Opening shot: mid-shot.
                    Frame is pitch black, nothing is to be seen. (stage lights sound effect starts) white Spotlight lights center of frame with our character being blinded by the light (like the Mr Bean intro). Reacts like a possum in the headlights of a car. (the sound of more stage lights begin to click, like the batcave scene. *see reference board*) bright white LED panels light the entire room, which reveals nothing much but a blank room and the character.
                <br><br>
                Characters body language and facial expressions portray a shy/timid creature which does not like being “in the spotlight”. The character is confused about where it is and what is going on.
                <br><br>

                The character spots something off screen which the audience cannot see. A 3D computer cursor floats into the shot from right to left. 
                <br><br>

                Character is curious as to what this strange thing is. Cautiously looking at the cursor, the cursor suddenly floats around the back of the character and clicks on its bottom. Character jumps and reacts with a slight hop. The character is still quite unsure about what just happened, but a little more cautiously this time looks towards the floating cursor.
                <br><br>
                As the cursor slowly starts to move again, the Character tries to slowly follow around with the cursor hoping not to be caught off guard like last time. Suddenly the mouse quickly whips around the back of the character and clicks on its bottom again. With another jump from the character.
                <br><br>

                Now the Character has some idea of what is going on and is beginning to become upset at the situation (shown both with body and face language). The audience should also get a clue about what is going on. 
                <br><br>

                So now the duet has begun, the cursor starts to slowly “prowl” around the character. Almost like a western movie standoff. The cursor’s movement is too fast for our character and begins to click him over and over again, almost toying with him,
                <br><br>

                The Character does not like this one bit. The cursor starts to get really cheeky and starts to laugh (through body language), Suddenly there is a change in lighting as the character begins to growl, followed by shaking of his fur, followed by an angry expression and growing of his body size.
                <br><br>

                The camera slowly zooms out to show the size comparison between the mouse and character now. The character mammoths the size of the small cursor.
                <br><br>

                Our character has a big grin come across his face as he twists his body in anticipation of a big release of energy. *The cursor gulps*.
                <br><br>

                The Character unwinds and begins a devastating spin attack, as the floor begins to tear towards the center and the cursor wooshes in a tornado of destruction. The camera which the audience is watching from also begins to shake and move towards the mess.
                <br><br>

                The camera screen cracks. Title “bashful” flies from off screen as announcer’s voice over says the name of the game and which devices you can purchase the game.

                            The early stages of this project brought up a few very important questions. For example: <br><br>
                            <span style="color: white; font-weight: bolder; font-size: 1.2rem;"> "What makes something cute?"</span><br><br>
                            A study by Konrad Lorenz in the early 1940s found that the shape of an infant's head positively correlated with adult caregiving and an increased perception of "cute". ... The study concluded that a large head shape increased perceived cuteness, which then elicited a positive response in adult caretaking.
                            <br><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Change of head proportions (especially the relative size of the maxilla and mandible) as a function of age</li>
                                <li>Use of eyebrows is an effective way of making puppy dog eyes</li>

                        <br><br>
                        This was a big one, there is both the look and feel of the character which is hard enough on it's own. There was also the question of the rig
                        and how to acheive the type of movement that I am going for.
                        <br><br>
                        It has been a long time since I have played with rigging and "all of its wonderful features!"... Hahaha, no but after a few years
                        of life experience, alot more things are clicking and I was able to pull off a pretty successful Squash and stretch rig setup.
                        <br><br>
                        I will need much more experimentation to see exactly what type of animation movement I am going for. Will keep you posted.

                        There is a whole lot to learn when it comes to fur/hair, as our tutor said "Fur has its own entire industry, within the industry". <br><br>

                        A but daunting I know, but my families motto has always been "do the mahi! get the treats!". So I am going to dive head first into this one. <br><br>

                        Pretty early stages as of now, making some progress towards the goal. But still quite a bit of work to do in order to get ito looking how I want.

                The background of our character "bashful" is an interesting story. <br>
                You see, the particular species which bashful comes from, reproduce VERY quickly, which makes finding enough land for them to live on exponentially more difficult. Last I checked they spawn 30 young : 1 grown. each month. <br>
                our character bashful may look cute and peaceful on the outside, but that is just a genetic modification to bring people in close enough to devour them. <br><br>

                Anyway's I digress, he is looking for more planets to help the expansion of his species. despite the looks, bashful is actually an elite "scout" from his home galaxy "bluffel" (even the galexy names are cute!).<br>
                <br><br><br>
                Oh. and the cursor is human(teenager).
